# GradeMaths

GradeMaths is a command-line application that provides a set of tools for performing common mathematical calculations. It is built using Python and the `rich` library to create a user-friendly and visually appealing terminal interface.

## Features

-   **Find Factors**: Find all the factors of a given number.
-   **Find LCM**: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
-   **Find HCF**: Find the highest common factor (HCF) of two numbers.
-   **Find Product**: Find the product of two numbers.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can then install the required dependencies and run the `main.py` script.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will then prompt you to enter two numbers. Once you have entered the numbers, you will be presented with a menu of options to choose from.

## Menu Options

-   **Find factors of both numbers**: This option will find all the factors of the two numbers you entered.
-   **Find LCM of the numbers**: This option will find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers.
-   **Find HCF of the numbers**: This option will find the highest common factor (HCF) of the two numbers.
-   **Find product of the numbers**: This option will find the product of the two numbers.
-   **Find factors, LCM, HCF and products**: This option will find all the factors, LCM, HCF, and product of the two numbers.
-   **Enter two new numbers**: This option will allow you to enter two new numbers to perform calculations on.
-   **Exit**: This option will exit the application.
